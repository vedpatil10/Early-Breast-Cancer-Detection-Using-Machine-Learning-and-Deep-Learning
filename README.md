Early Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning & Deep Learning
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on early detection of breast cancer using machine learning and deep learning models. The system classifies mammogram images into Benign or Malignant, helping in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

ðŸš€ Features

Multiple ML/DL models implemented: SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, CNN, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, AdaBoost

Highest accuracy achieved:

XGBoost â€“ 93.4%

Random Forest â€“ 93.1%

CNN â€“ 91.9%

Applied SMOTE to handle class imbalance

Image preprocessing techniques: PCA, Otsuâ€™s Thresholding, Histogram Equalization, Contour & Sobel Edge Detection

Performance evaluated using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC
