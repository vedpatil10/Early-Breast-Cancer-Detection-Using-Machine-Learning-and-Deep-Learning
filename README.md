Early Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning
Overview
This project focuses on early detection of breast cancer using machine learning and deep learning models. The system classifies mammogram images into Benign or Malignant, supporting early diagnosis and treatment planning.

Features
Implemented multiple models: SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost, CNN, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, AdaBoost
Highest accuracy achieved:
XGBoost – 93.4%
Random Forest – 93.1%
CNN – 91.9%
Applied SMOTE to handle class imbalance
Image preprocessing techniques: PCA, Otsu’s Thresholding, Histogram Equalization, Contour Detection, Sobel Edge Detection
Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC
